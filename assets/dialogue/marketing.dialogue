You: Oh this is the speaker from yesterday. I am so lucky to have started on Signums 50th anniversary. It was smart of the marketing-team to use this opportunity to make a brilliant LinkedIn post.  
You: I remember talking to Signe introducing me to what marketing is responsible of. 
Signe: Marketing is promoting Signum and Atrium on different channels, website, LinkedIn, events, google, banners, partnerships, and email marketing.  
The marketing team is the key in translating the pharma terms and specialist knowledge into something that is appealing to our target audience.  
All this is done through content (ads, LinkedIn posts, news letters, videos, and the whole visual identify (design nice and consistent PowerPoint templates and web interfaces))
